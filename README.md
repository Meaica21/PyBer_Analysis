# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

For this challenge, it will show differences of fares per city type in a weekly basis as well as fares per ride using groupby() and sum methods for pandas.
In addition, using Matplotlib library, it will present the visualization of the fares trends per city.

## Results:

Based on the output shown on Figure 1, more drivers are available in Urban places compared to Suburban and Rural areas. Hence, more income will be collected for Urban area. In addition, the fares per ride is cheaper than the fares per ride in Rural and Suburban areas. However, the profit per driver in Urban areas is lesser than the profit of drivers in Suburban and Rural. 

There are more commuters and public transportation in Urban areas unlike in Rural and Suburban areas where there is less demand and therefore less transportation services. Also, parking fees can be expensive in Urban areas, leading people to opt for public transportation.

Figure 1: Summary of Fares per Ride against Fares per Driver

## Summary:

One recommendation I would suggest to CEO is to have customer in suburban and rural areas to attract more customers.  Since your rural and suburban areas have the highest profit margins, we want to expand this market if possible.

My second recommendation is to lower the costs per driver in suburban areas.  By focusing on employeesâ€™ that closer to suburban and rural areas, we could have them focus their services at the beginning and end of their shifts which will be more near to their home.  In conclusion, we would not have to incentivize them with pay since they would be incentivized with convenience of working closer to home.

It is also noted that there are more employees than rides in urban areas, meaning that we should consider total ride quotas per driver per month.  There are likely large differences between the rides given by each driver.
